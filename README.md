My name is Cyril Makil.  I am a currently a Pharmacist for 13 years.  I live in Plano, Tx

Future goals are to become full time into Consulting in Fintech/Blockchain and also getting my CFP and work in Wealth Management possibly.

After years in healthcare, I became hungry to learn something that challenged me and also provided service to everyday peeople around me.  I became emmersed in Blockchain technology and believe that it is an extremely valuable technology and offers a great investment vehicle.
